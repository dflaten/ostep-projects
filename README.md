Projects for the book: Operating Systems, Three Easy Steps

Plan to build the projects listed in this [repo](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects) and store them here.


## Initial Projects

### WGET
The program wcat is a simple program. Generally, it reads a file as specified by the user and prints its contents. A typical usage is as follows, in which the user wants to see the contents of main.c, and thus types:

```
prompt> ./wcat main.c
#include <stdio.h>
...
```
